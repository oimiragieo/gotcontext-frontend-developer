# Gooey Blob System Skill

## Use When
- A page needs organic fluid shapes that visually merge, separate, and move as one soft system.

## Workflow
1. Build the effect with SVG filters: Gaussian blur followed by a color matrix threshold.
2. Animate multiple overlapping circles or blobs so they approach and separate naturally.
3. Keep boundaries soft and continuous; the visual should feel fluid rather than like separate circles.
4. Use the blob system as a background accent, loader, cursor field, or hero atmosphere.
5. Tune blur, contrast, and shape spacing together so merging remains visible.

## Guardrails
- Do not fake gooey behavior with plain blurred circles that never merge.
- Do not add fast jittery motion; keep it smooth and cohesive.
- Provide a static or simplified fallback for low-motion contexts.
